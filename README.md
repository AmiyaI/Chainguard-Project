# Chainguard Interview Project üöÄ

## Overview

This project is part of my preparation for the **Technical Support Enginner** application at Chainguard. It showcases my skills in setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS using Terraform and Helm, specifically deploying a **Chainguard NGINX** application. The project demonstrates my understanding of infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, Kubernetes, and Helm.

## Project Components üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Terraform Configuration (`terraform/`)

- **`eks.tf`**: Defines the configuration for setting up an Amazon EKS cluster. The cluster is configured to use **three availability zones** for high availability and resilience. It includes managed node groups, network configurations, and essential add-ons like **CoreDNS, Kube-Proxy,** and **VPC-CNI**.
- **`provider.tf`**: Specifies the AWS provider and sets up local variables for region, cluster name, and networking details.
- **`vpc.tf`**: Manages the VPC, including public, private, and intra subnets across three availability zones. The intra subnets are specifically designed for the EKS control plane.

### 2. Kubernetes Manifests (`manifests/`)

- **`deployment.yml`**: Initially used to deploy the **Chainguard NGINX** application with three replicas.
- **`service.yml`**: Defines the **LoadBalancer** service to expose the NGINX application externally.

### 3. Helm Chart (`chainguard-nginx/`)

- **Helm Chart Overview**: The Helm chart manages the NGINX deployment and was derived from the Kubernetes manifests. It offers a more scalable and manageable approach to deployment.
- **`values.yaml`**: Customizable parameters for the Helm chart, including the **Chainguard NGINX** image and service configuration.
- **`Chart.yaml`**: Defines metadata for the Helm chart, including the chart and application versions.

### 4. `.gitignore` üìù

- The **`.gitignore`** file ensures that sensitive or unnecessary files, such as Terraform state files and Helm packaging outputs, are not committed to version control.

## Project Execution ‚öôÔ∏è

### Initial Setup

- I started by defining my infrastructure using Terraform. The Terraform files set up the necessary AWS components, including the VPC, subnets, and the EKS cluster with managed node groups.

### Kubernetes Manifests

- I deployed the **NGINX** application using basic Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yml` and `service.yml`). This approach helped me understand the manual process of deploying applications on Kubernetes.

### Transition to Helm

- I then transitioned to using **Helm** for managing the NGINX deployment. I derived the Helm chart (`chainguard-nginx/`) from the Kubernetes manifests, which allowed for more flexibility, scalability, and easier management of the application.

## Usage of Chainguard Images üõ°Ô∏è

- **Chainguard Images** were chosen for this project due to their **zero CVEs** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) policy, ensuring that the deployed containers are secure by default. This is critical for maintaining a robust security posture, especially in production environments. The images are also optimized for minimal size and attack surface, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and improving performance.

- By using Chainguard Images, I demonstrate an understanding of best practices in container security, which is essential for the role at Chainguard. The ability to deploy secure, compliant applications without the need for constant patching aligns with Chainguard‚Äôs mission of securing the software supply chain by default.

## Steps to Deploy üöÄ

1. **Set up the infrastructure using Terraform:**

   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

   This command sets up the AWS infrastructure, including the VPC, subnets, and the EKS cluster.

2. **Deploy the NGINX application using Kubernetes manifests:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yml
   kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yml
   ```

   This deploys the NGINX application and exposes it via a LoadBalancer service.

3. **Deploy the NGINX application using Helm:**

   ```bash
   helm install chainguard-nginx ./chainguard-nginx
   ```

   This deploys the NGINX application using the Helm chart, providing a more scalable and manageable deployment method.

4. **Access the NGINX application:**

   Once deployed, you can access the NGINX application via the LoadBalancer's external IP or DNS name.

## Project Benefits üéØ

This project showcases my ability to set up and manage cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Kubernetes and to transition from manual deployment using manifests to a more automated and scalable approach using Helm. It demonstrates my understanding of key DevOps principles and tools relevant to the **Associate Software Engineer (DevOps)** role at Chainguard.

## üöÄ Future Improvements & Industry Best Practices

### 1. **Enhanced Security with Network Policies**
   - **Why:** To minimize the attack surface by controlling communication between pods.
   - **How:** Implement Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources to restrict traffic and limit external access.

### 2. **Implementing Secrets Management**
   - **Why:** Secure sensitive data such as API keys and passwords.
   - **How:** Integrate a secrets management tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage.

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - **Why:** Automate deployment processes for consistency and speed.
   - **How:** Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate Terraform and Kubernetes deployments.

### 4. **Implementing Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Why:** To maintain application health and security through visibility.
   - **How:** Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring; use Fluentd or ELK stack for centralized logging.

### 5. **Enhanced Auto-Scaling and Load Management**
   - **Why:** Ensure efficient handling of traffic with auto-scaling.
   - **How:** Use Kubernetes HPA and Cluster Autoscaler to scale pods and nodes based on real-time metrics.

### 6. **Advanced Helm Chart Customizations**
   - **Why:** Improve modularity and manage multiple environments effectively.
   - **How:** Use Helmfile or environment values for consistent and easy deployment configurations.

### 7. **Security Hardening with Chainguard Images**
   - **Why:** Chainguard images provide a secure foundation with zero CVEs, reducing vulnerabilities in containerized applications.
   - **How:** Regularly scan images with tools like Trivy or Grype, and enforce image policies using OPA Gatekeeper to ensure only trusted images are deployed.

### 8. **Improved Documentation and Onboarding**
   - **Why:** Facilitate quicker onboarding and better understanding of the project.
   - **How:** Expand documentation and add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for contributing.

### 9. **Using Variable Files (`vars` files)**
   - **Why:** Centralizing configuration in variable files enhances the manageability and reusability of my Terraform and Helm configurations. It allows for easier adjustments across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) without modifying the main configuration files directly.
   - **How:** Create a `variables.tf` or a `vars.yaml` file where I define all configurable parameters. I can then reference these variables in my Terraform and Helm configurations. This approach makes my infrastructure more modular, reduces the risk of errors, and simplifies the process of scaling or updating deployments.

Integrating variable files would further align the project with industry standards, making it easier to maintain and scale.

## Conclusion üèÅ

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in cloud infrastructure management, Kubernetes, and Helm. It aligns with the responsibilities outlined in the job description and reflects my readiness to contribute effectively to the Chainguard team.
